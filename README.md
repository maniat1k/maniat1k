# Hi, I'm Marcelo 👋

💻 Tech tinkerer | 🧠 Automation enthusiast | 🎧 Music lover | 📚 Always learning  
I build simple tools to solve real problems — from shell scripts and system tweaks to terminal theming and maintenance helpers.

🔧 Focused on:
- Linux/Windows optimization
- Bash scripting and automation
- Clean, minimalist configurations (ZSH, VMs, etc.)

🚀 Projects worth checking:
- [Solarizedxterm](https://github.com/maniat1k/solarizedxterm) — Terminal color theme for better readability
- [birame](https://github.com/maniat1k/birame) — ZSH theme inspired by "bira" with practical tweaks
- [windows11_fixMBR](https://github.com/maniat1k/windows11_fixMBR) — Restore your Windows bootloader
